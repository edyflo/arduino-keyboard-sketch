# Arduino Keyboard Sketch

This sketch sends keystrokes from an Arduino to a computer when the Arduino is set up as USB keyboard. After loading this sketch onto your Arduino, you'll need to flash [Darran's USB HID keyboard firmware](https://github.com/harlequin-tech/arduino-usb/tree/master/firmwares/arduino-keyboard) onto your Arduino. You can alternatively use my [fork of Darran's keyboard firmware](https://github.com/trusktr/arduino-usb/tree/master/firmwares/arduino-keyboard) which is modified for the Arduino UNO R3.
